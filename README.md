Abstract:<br>

Home delivery service is an essential service for online shopping. The need for reliable delivery system to ensure freshness of foods is challenging with consumers' busy schedule and heavy traffic. In this paper, we present a low-cost real-time GPS system that allows customers to schedule their food delivery more efficiently. Using this GPS system, consumers are able to track their delivery and arrival of their grocery to ensure the freshness of products. Additionally, a user-friendly online grocery shopping system is presented for retailer to promote their products and for customers to select their grocery in a more time-saving method. This website was developed to support the limited number of grocery online shopping websites in Hong Kong. To create the user-friendly access website, we have incooperated four functions in this website: Online shopping cart, system to support various payment methods, GPS food tracking system, and members' easily access account data system. This low-cost online system is designed to provide simple access for retailers (administrator, staff), customers, and visitor for creating a friendly online shopping standard.
