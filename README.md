<b>IoT for Online Shopping System - HKMall</b><br>
Abstract
```
We are IT114103/2A students from Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education of
Tsing Yi Campus. We are going to set up an IoT online shopping system which is
called “HKMall Online Shopping System” for our Final Year Project.
Nowadays, online shopping is very common in everywhere. For example, Hong Kong
people always buy things on Taobao. Not only the prices of the goods are cheaper
than Hong Kong, but also convenient to customers because they do not need to go to
entity store. However, customers may look forward to the goods so they want to
know the location of the orders when they are shipping and they can spend the time
to receive the delivery. That’s why we are going to add the GPS system to track arrival
of the orders.
In this final report, we will present the final version of our system. In this report, the
test case and user guide were included. In addition, it also included some updated
development and new functions of the system.
